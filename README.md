# thesis_Digital_Environment

This is the repo for the prototype of my Master's thesis.

Each folder contains a different application that needs to be initiated before use.

The Solid Pod servers can be started immediately with the command:
"npm run dev"
This is a shorthand introduced for "community-solid-server -c @css:config/file.json -p 5000"
